Additive is distributed on Modrinth. You can install it through any third-party launcher that supports Modrinth packs, or through our standalone installer for the Mojang launcher.

**Before installing either Adrenaline or Additive, make sure to read Sodium's [Driver Compatibility](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) page if you are on an old device to prevent issues.**

# Installing with third-party launchers

If you prefer to use a third-party option such as the Modrinth App, Prism Launcher, ATLauncher, or anything else that supports Modrinth modpacks, simply [follow the instructions from Modrinth](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/).

# Installing for the Mojang launcher

If you don't want to install any third-party stuff, you can use the Additive installer which lets you select a version to download and install to the Minecraft launcher. You can also choose to install Adrenaline through here. This installer is made by Gaming32 - please go [here](https://github.com/Gaming32/additive-installer/issues) to report issues and suggest features for the project.
