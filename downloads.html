    <h1>Downloads</h1>
    <p>
      Additive is distributed on Modrinth. You can install it through any
      third-party launcher that supports Modrinth packs, or through our
      standalone installer for the Mojang launcher.

    <h2>With third-party launchers</h2>
    <p>
      If you prefer to use a third-party option such as the Modrinth App, Prism
      Launcher, ATLauncher, or anything else that supports Modrinth modpacks,
      simply follow the instructions from
      <a href="https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/"
        >Modrinth's documentation</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>For the Mojang launcher</h2>
    <p>
      If you don't want to install any third-party stuff, you can use the
      Additive installer which lets you select a version to download and install
      to the Minecraft launcher. You can also choose to install Adrenaline
      through here. Please go
